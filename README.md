## Password Generator
Set Your Secure Password:

- Enter a strong and memorable password in the "Enter Password" field.

Toggle Password Visibility:

- Use the üëÅ button to toggle visibility for reviewing your entered password.
  
Choose Character Types:

- Select the character types you want in your password: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols.
  
Adjust Password Length:

Generate Password:

- Click "Generate Password" to create a secure password based on your preferences.
  
Copy to Clipboard:

- Click "Copy" to copy the generated password to your clipboard for easy use.
  
## Notes: 

- For AES-256-GCM mode, a password is required for encryption and decryption.

- Ensure to keep your password secure to maintain the confidentiality of your data. I recommend utilizing KeepassXC for secure password management.

- After decryption, it is essential to remove the '_decrypted' suffix and appropriately adjust the file name. Failure to do so may result in issues opening the file. For instance, if the original file was named 'Test.txt_decrypted,' change it to 'Test_decrypted.txt' or any desired format.

- An efficient approach to handle encryption and decryption is by encrypting an entire folder. This method eliminates the need to manually adjust file names for the process to function seamlessly.
